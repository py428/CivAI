# CivAI 🌍  
**AI for Civilization – Turning NASA Earth data into cleaner, cooler, more resilient cities.**  

## 🚀 About the Project  
CivAI is an AI-powered platform that combines **NASA Earth observation data** with local air quality sensors to map urban pollution hotspots and recommend the most effective tree-planting locations.  
It empowers **urban planners and communities** to take immediate, science-based action for healthier cities.  

- **Challenge:** NASA Space Apps 2025 – *Data Pathways to Healthy Cities and Human Settlements*  
- **Team:** CivAI Atlas (Bangladesh)  

## 🛰️ NASA Data Sources  
- **MODIS Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD)** – Aqua/Terra satellites  
- **VIIRS Active Fire Data** – Suomi NPP & NOAA-20 satellites  

## 💡 Features  
- Real-time pollution hotspot mapping  
- AI-driven tree-planting recommendations  
- Scenario simulator: predict AQI and heat reduction after interventions  
- Interactive dashboard (Streamlit)  
- Already supports 40 global cities including Dhaka, Delhi, and New York  

## 🖥️ Demo

## 📂 Repository Structure  
- `app.py` → Main Streamlit app  
- `requirements.txt` → Dependencies  
- `.gitignore` → Ignored files  
- `.devcontainer/` → Dev environment setup 

## 🔮 Future Plans  
- Integrate climate projections (e.g., 2030 scenarios)  
- Expand to 100+ cities worldwide  
- Partner with NGOs and city governments for real tree-planting campaigns  

## 🙌 Credits
